# De-Cloud

### Visit the App: [de-cloud.vercel.app/](https://de-cloud.vercel.app/)

**De-cloud** is a web app that let you store all your sensitive data in one place such as your passwords, notes, files or wallets.

De-Cloud harnesses the power of the Decentralized Web Network, or DWN, to securely store your passwords, notes, files, and even your wallets. It's built on three key principles of digital security:

 - Decentralization: Using technologies of Web5.js, De-Cloud makes sure your data isn't stored in just one place, which could be easily attacked.

 - Security: De-Cloud uses AES-CBC encryption for transferring your sensitive data, making it much harder for unauthorized people to get their hands on it.

 - Self-ownership: You host your own node, giving you total control over your data.

De-Cloud is more than just an app; it's a bold statement. It showcases the incredible potential of decentralization and cloud technology through Web5.js, putting the control and ownership of your data back in your hands. With De-Cloud, you're not only protecting your digital assets; you're championing privacy and security in our digital age.

## Set-Up
First of all, host your own DWN. You can see more details here: [Web5.js DWN Server doc](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server)\
Then, enter the link of your DWN server on the landing page of the app.

To upload a file you have to create a Pinata account.
Then you will be able to input your wanted gateway domain and your JWT (available when creating a API Token) in the file tab.

You are ready to go!
